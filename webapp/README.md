# A first webapp

See [slides](Clojure tools & ecosystem.pdf).

## Excercise

  1. Use hiccup/enlive to generate an HTML page containing a text input form and an unordered list
  2. Populate unordered list with messages from an atom
  3. Add a GET route using compojure that returns the page
  4. Add a POST route that stores the entered text in the atom and redirects back to the page
  5. Create a server using http-kit that serves your app
